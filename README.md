# **Protocol Risk Simulation Engine (PRSE)**
🚀 **Risk Simulation Engine for DeFi Protocols**  

The **Protocol Risk Simulation Engine (PRSE)** is an open-source risk assessment and simulation framework for **decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocols**. PRSE enables developers, risk analysts, and governance participants to model market conditions, **stress-test lending protocols**, and **optimize key parameters** to enhance **protocol resilience**.

> **Why PRSE?**  
> DeFi lending protocols face **high collateral requirements, cascading liquidations, and market volatility risks**. PRSE provides real-time risk monitoring and **data-driven parameter optimization** to enhance security and capital efficiency. For lenders, it offers a new perspective on the risks they face.

## 🌟 **Key Features**
- 🔹 **Stress-Testing Engine** – Simulate market shocks, cascading liquidations, and risk scenarios  
- 🔹 **Real-Time Risk Dashboard** – Monitor protocol health metrics, collateralization levels, and reserve adequacy  
- 🔹 **Dynamic Risk Rating** – Evaluate lending protocols under different price conditions  
- 🔹 **Overleverage Detection** – Identify high-risk recursive borrowing loops  
- 🔹 **Integration with DeFi Protocols** – Supports **Aave, Compound, JustLend**, and more  
- 🔹 **VaR & CVaR Analysis** – Statistical risk modeling to quantify loss potential

## 🏗 **How It Works**
PRSE models DeFi lending protocols using **on-chain and off-chain data**, feeding into a **high-performance Risk Simulation Engine**. The system operates in **five stages**:

1. **Data Collection** – Fetches live DeFi lending data (collateral levels, liquidation thresholds, market prices)  
2. **ETL Processing** – Normalizes raw data into a structured database for risk computation  
3. **Simulation Engine** – Executes stress tests, cascading liquidation analysis, and risk assessments  
4. **Risk Scoring & Parameter Optimization** – Assigns risk scores and recommends optimal collateral/interest rate adjustments  
5. **Visualization & API Access** – Provides a web dashboard for real-time monitoring and API access for protocol developers

## ⚙ **System Architecture**
PRSE follows a modular, scalable design:

- **Frontend:** Next.js-based UI for real-time dashboards and user interaction  
- **Backend:** Python-powered Risk Simulation Engine optimized with **Ray for parallel computation**  
- **Database:** Hybrid **TimescaleDB & BigQuery** for scalable time-series storage  
- **ETL Pipeline:** Apache **Airflow-driven** data processing for high-frequency updates  
- **External Integrations:** Uses **The Graph, JSON-RPC, and Chainlink price oracles**
